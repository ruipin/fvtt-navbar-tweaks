# FVTT Navbar Tweaks
Module for Foundry VTT that provides some tweaks for the navbar.


## Features

* Allows hiding the navbar for all players below a specific role. This can be used by the GM to hide the current scene name from players.

* Allows configuring the role above which the navbar will always show the real name of the scene, instead of the 'Navigation Name' configured in the Scene settings. This is useful to avoid spoilers, while still allowing the GM to distinguish between similar scenes. For example, the players might just see 'City', but the GM sees 'City (before attack)', 'City (during attack)' and 'City (after attack)'.
